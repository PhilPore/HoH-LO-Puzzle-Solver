# HoH-LO-Puzzle-Solver
In Heroes of Hammerwatch, there is a 3x3 puzzle that is a variant of Lights Out. When you touch a cell, it toggles the adjacent cells around it as on or off. The goal is to flip all the cells on. While I like puzzles I am also pretty lazy, so I coded up a puzzle solver for this.
